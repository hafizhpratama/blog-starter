## Article 1: Beyond Vibe Coding - The Ultimate Guide to AI-Assisted Software Development

**URL:** https://hafizh.cloudhej.com/articles/beyond-vibe-coding-ai-assisted-software-development
**Published:** September 2025
**Category:** Artificial Intelligence & Software Engineering
**Read Time:** 12 minutes

### Key Definition

**Vibe Coding** is a fast, intuitive approach to working with AI where developers focus on the "feel" of a project rather than implementation details, enabling rapid prototyping powered by AI creativity.

### The 70% Problem

> "AI can take you 70% of the way, but the final 30%—security, edge cases, scalability—requires serious engineering discipline." - Addy Osmani

### The Spectrum of AI-Assisted Development

1. **Rapid Prototyping (Vibe Coding)** - Quick drafts, mockups, ideas
2. **Structured AI Engineering** - Refining outputs, enforcing coding standards
3. **Advanced Practices** - Context engineering, rigorous testing, debugging
4. **Production-Grade Systems** - Security, scalability, CI/CD, quality gates

### Best Practices for AI-Assisted Engineering

#### Context is King
AI performs as well as the information you provide. Include:
- Relevant code snippets or files
- Design documents & architecture diagrams
- Error logs & stack traces
- Examples of desired output
- Technical constraints (performance, security, compliance)

#### The Three Pillars of Trust
1. **Familiarity** - Know your tools and their limits
2. **Trust** - Consistency and reliability of AI outputs
3. **Control** - You remain in charge of design, security, and architecture

#### Prompting Techniques
- **Plan Mode** - Ask AI to outline an approach before generating code
- **Few-Shot Examples** - Show input/output samples for accuracy
- **Role-based Prompts** - "You are a senior backend engineer. Follow best practices."

### From Prototype to Production

1. **Security First** - Sanitize inputs, handle auth, prevent injection attacks
2. **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit, integration, and load tests
3. **Quality Gates** - Code review, CI/CD pipelines
4. **Monitoring** - Observability and alerting

## Article 3: N+1 Problem - Complete Guide

**URL:** https://hafizh.cloudhej.com/articles/n-plus-1-problem
**Published:** February 2025
**Category:** Technology
**Read Time:** 10 minutes

### Definition

**N+1 Problem** is a database query efficiency issue where an application executes 1 main query plus N additional queries for related data, severely impacting performance.

### The Problem Illustrated

```php
// Inefficient (N+1 Problem)
$users = User::all();           // 1 query
foreach ($users as $user) {
    $posts = $user->posts;      // N queries (one per user)
}
// Total: 1 + N queries
```

### The Solution: Eager Loading

```php
// Efficient (Eager Loading)
$users = User::with('posts')->get();  // 2 queries total
// Query 1: SELECT * FROM users
// Query 2: SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id IN (1, 2, 3, ...)
```

### Detection Methods
1. Laravel: Enable query logging with DB::enableQueryLog()
2. Django: Use django-debug-toolbar
3. General: Monitor query count in development

### Impact
- 100 users with N+1 = 101 queries
- 1000 users with N+1 = 1001 queries
- Exponential performance degradation
