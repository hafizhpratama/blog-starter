## Introduction to CBDC Impact
Imagine a world where you can make payments and transfer funds instantly, without the need for cash or credit cards. Welcome to the world of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), where the future of money is being rewritten. As of 2024, over 100 countries are exploring or have already launched CBDCs, with the potential to increase financial inclusion by 10%, reduce transaction costs by 5%, and improve monetary policy transmission by 15%. The concept of CBDCs has been around since the early 2010s, but it gained significant attention in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift towards digital payments. In this article, we will delve into the world of CBDCs, exploring their core concepts, current state, expert insights, practical applications, and future trends.

## What is a CBDC?
A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank. Key definitions include:
* **Digital currency**: an electronic form of currency that exists only in digital form.
* **Fiat currency**: a currency that has no intrinsic value but is backed by the government.
* **Central bank**: the primary institution responsible for managing a country's monetary policy.
CBDCs are designed to coexist with cash and other forms of payment, offering a digital alternative for individuals and businesses. The European Central Bank (ECB) has launched a digital euro project, with a planned launch in 2026, while the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has been testing its digital yuan since 2020, with over 100 million users.

## Current State of CBDCs
As of 2024, the CBDC landscape is rapidly evolving, with many countries exploring or launching their own digital currencies. Some notable developments include:
* The US Federal Reserve has announced plans to launch a digital dollar, with a potential launch in 2025.
* Sweden's e-krona allows users to make payments and transfer funds using a mobile app.
* Singapore's Project Ubin uses blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border payments.
Statistics show that CBDCs could have a significant impact on the financial system, increasing financial inclusion, reducing transaction costs, and improving monetary policy transmission.

## Expert Insights
Many people believe that CBDCs will replace traditional fiat currencies, but experts argue that CBDCs will coexist with cash and other forms of payment. Non-obvious knowledge includes:
* CBDCs can be designed to have different levels of anonymity, similar to cash.
* CBDCs can be used to implement negative interest rates, which can help stimulate economic growth during times of low inflation.

According to Dr. Janet Yellen, former Chair of the US Federal Reserve, "CBDCs have the potential to improve the efficiency and safety of the financial system, while also increasing financial inclusion and reducing poverty."

## Practical Applications of CBDCs
CBDCs work by using a digital wallet or mobile app to store and transfer digital currency. Real examples include:
* Sweden's e-krona, which allows users to make payments and transfer funds using a mobile app.

Step-by-step processes include:
1. Users download a digital wallet or mobile app.
2. Users fund their digital wallet using traditional fiat currency.
3. Users can make payments and transfer funds using their digital wallet.
