## Core Concepts of Quantum Computing
To understand Quantum Computing, it's essential to grasp its core concepts. **Qubits** (quantum bits) are the fundamental units of quantum information, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to the phenomenon of **superposition**. **Quantum gates** are the quantum equivalent of logic gates in classical computing, used to manipulate qubits. **Quantum algorithms** are the programs that run on quantum computers, designed to solve specific problems. The history of Quantum Computing dates back to the 1980s, with significant advancements in the 1990s and 2000s. Notably, the concept of quantum computing was first proposed by physicist David Deutsch in 1982.
